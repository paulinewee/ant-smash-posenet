# ant-smash-posenet

I created Ant Smasher, one of my favorite childhood games.

It features:

- multiple game settings
- music and sound effects for squishing ants and losing
- a swatter cursor
- hover effects on the buttons
- different types and speeds of generated ants
- a timer
- 3 lives that you can visually deplete
- a visual effect as the ants eat the candy
- custom designed start and end pages
- a settings page to choose settings from
- The ants splice off the list when they die or go offscreen, and everything resets (though your high score is stored) so you can keep playing again and again.

The only thing I would add are other themes: e.g. Spaceship Smasher, Rat Smasher, Campus Cat Smasher, Worm On A string Smasher, etc. Same concept, different sprites, and a way to change them in the settings, probably by using global variables. I just have to fix the settings page to make space for them.

Random other thoughts about what to add: multiple soundtracks, psychedelic video backgrounds, animated sprites, notification banners for when you reach certain milestones, a leaderboard, etc. I would have done these, but I didn’t think they would add much to the final product, and might just be a lot of work for slightly more distraction.

I fixed the scaling of the design elements and adjusted the gameplay settings so that they match this style of play, which is slower but so much more fun. Your nose plays the swatter. If you can play this on hard mode, you’re the GOAT.
